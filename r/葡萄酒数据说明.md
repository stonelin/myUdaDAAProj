1. - fixed.acidity (非挥发性酸): most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)（大多数酸会影响酒、稳定和挥发性）

2. - volatile.acidity（挥发性酸）: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste(太多的乙酸会让葡萄酒的口味变差)


3. - citric.acid（柠檬酸）: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines（少量的柠檬酸会增加葡萄酒的新鲜感和口味）

4. - residual.sugar（残余糖分）: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet（发酵后剩余的糖分很少有低于1克/升的，超过45克/升的葡萄酒被认为是甜的）

5. - chlorides（氯化物，含盐量）: the amount of salt in the wine

6. - free.sulfur.dioxide（游离二氧化硫）: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine(游离态的二氧化硫保持在分子和离子之间，可以防止微生物生长和葡萄酒氧化)

7. - total.sulfur.dioxide (总二氧化硫): amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine(二氧化硫总量；浓度低时二氧化硫大多检测不到，但是当游离态SO2浓度超过50ppm后 就变得很明显，可以用鼻子闻到)

8. - density（密度）: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content（取决于酒精和糖的含量）

9. - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale（葡萄酒的ph值， 大多数在3-4）

10. - sulphates(硫酸盐): a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant（葡萄酒的添加剂，会提高二氧化硫（S02）指标，是一种抗菌和抗氧化）

11. - alcohol（酒精度）: the percent alcohol content of the wine

12. - quality (score between 0 and 10) 

元素含量单位都是 g/dm^3,也就是g/L
